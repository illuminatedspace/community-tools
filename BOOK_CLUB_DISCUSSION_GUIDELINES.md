# Book Club Discussion Guidelines
Version 1.0

## Goal
The goal of these guidelines is to facilitate a productive and respectful discourse while exploring the sensitive topics covered by the books in Book Club.

## Amendments
Any member of the community is welcome to suggest amendments to these guidelines through [GitHub](https://github.com/illuminatedspace/community-tools/blob/master/BOOK_CLUB_DISCUSSION_GUIDELINES.md), the IlluminatedSpace Discord, or by discussing it with the Server Admin directly (see the Code of Conduct for contact information).

## Guidelines
1. All participation in the course of discussion must follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/illuminatedspace/community-tools/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2. Unless specified otherwise, the foundational topic the book is built upon is not a topic for discussion. For example: If the book is about defining and responding to sexism in our patriarchal society the fact that there is sexism and our society is patriarchal is not up for debate during the discussion.
3. Discussion will be turn based. Members of Book Club should avoid cross talk and interrupting the active speaker. However a discussion moderator may interrupt in an attempt to distribute response time among the participants who wish to speak.
4. Participants should not attempt to address portions of the book being discussed that they haven't read. Finishing the book is not a prerequisite to participate in the discussion, but participants should be mindful of what parts of the book they do and do not have context for.
