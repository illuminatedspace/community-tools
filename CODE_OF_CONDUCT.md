# IlluminatedSpace Community Code of Conduct

## Enforcing the Code of Conduct

Each individual member of the community is responsible for following the code of conduct.
The server administrator and moderation team are responsible for ensuring the Code of Conduct is being upheld by the sanctioned activities and members of the community. If the Code of Conduct is not meeting the needs of the community the moderation team, but ultimately the administrator is responsible for making changes to the Code of Conduct.

### Server Administrator

Email: lizkristinaphillips [at] gmail [dot] com

### Moderation Team

Anyone on Discord with the `moderator` role on their account

## Reporting Violations

If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

1. If possible, let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s). That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.
2. If this doesn’t happen, or if you’re uncomfortable speaking up, you can contact anyone on the moderation team including the server administrator by direct messaging the server administrator or the moderation team. (See `Enforcing the Code of Conduct` above) If you need to log out to protect yourself, feel free to email the server administrator. When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.
3. As soon as available, a moderator will join, identify themselves, and take further action (see below), starting with a warning, then temporary deactivation, then long-term deactivation.

The moderation team will prioritize the well-being and comfort of those affected negatively by the violation over the comfort of the violator.
If the issue is with a moderator please contact the server administrator directly.

## Our Goal

This community is dedicated to providing an inclusive community for members to learn and socialize in a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free environment. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of community members in any form.

## Applicability and Scope

This code of conduct applies to all of this community's spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the moderation team.

## Toward a Welcoming and Safe Environment

We hope to create an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in a positive and affirming way. Examples of behavior that contributes to creating this sort of environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

## Anti-Harassment Statement

This community will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Examples of harassment include:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of "dead" or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they're not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual or group, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following - online or in the physical world.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.
- Jokes that resemble the above still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.
- Delivering "Devil's Advocate" arguments that espouse discrimination.

If you have questions or concerns about these issues please feel free to message the admin or ask for an opportunity to explore the issue with a moderator.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of our community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the moderation team by following the contact information in `Enforcing the Code of Conduct` above. If the person who is harassing you is on the moderation team, they will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident.

The moderation team will respond to any complaint as quickly as we can. If you do not get a timely response (for example, if moderation team members are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and/or contacting the administrator by email. You can reference the contact information under `Enforcing the Code of Conduct` above.

This code of conduct applies to our community's spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our members, especially the moderation team, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The moderation team reserves the right to exclude people from the community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior towards people who are not in this community.

In order to protect the moderation team from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. Filing false reports will be considered a violation of the Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement Process

Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care. If a member's immediate safety and security is threatened, a member of the moderation team may take any action that they deem appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from the community. Any permanent ban requires the approval of the the server admin. If you disagree with a moderation action, you can appeal it or bring your concerns to the server admin by direct message or email. See `Enforcing the Code of Conduct` for contact information.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of our members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

The IlluminatedSpace community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The moderation team will not act on complaints regarding:

- “Reverse”-isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” and “cisphobia”
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Communicating in a “tone” you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

The examples listed above are not against the Code of Conduct.

Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the moderation team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community and identification of the community member as a harasser to other members.
