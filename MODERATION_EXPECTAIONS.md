# Moderation Expectations

Moderators are expected to take appropriate action when they see Code of Conduct violations when possible, contact the server administrator when not possible, and let a server admin know if they are temporarily or permanently unable to meet these expectations.
For security reasons moderators are expected to have 2 Factor Authentication enabled on their Discord account.

Feedback on the community Code of Conduct, and to the server admin is welcome and appreciated.

Moderators are not required or expected to make any sort of time commitment, as this is not a job and does not come with pay.

Your family, health, job, and life are more important than moderating this community.
