# How to Start a Watch Party

We use Teleparty for watch parties because it's the most stable of the stream syncing apps out there and it works across multiple services.


## Prerequisites

 - [ ] Make sure you have the Teleparty browser extension downloaded: https://www.teleparty.com/.
 - [ ] Optional: it can help to pin the extension to the browser bar like Teleparty recommends.


## Start the Party

  1. Start the episode you're going to watch on a supported streaming platform and pause it.
  2. Click the "TP" Teleparty button on your browser. 
  3. A "Create A Teleparty" window should pop up. Ensure that "Only I Have Control" is unchecked to allow others to continue if they'd like.
  4. Click the "Start The Party" button.
  5. A link should be displayed. Ensure "Show Chat" in enabled.
  6. Copy the link. (Every time you click the "TP" button is clicked while a party is active will display the link.)
  7. Let the party people know it's time for the party in the `#watch-party` channel in the Discord server.
    - Ping `@watch-party`
    - Let them know what you're watching
    - Give people like 5 - 10 minutes to join before starting
  8. You can run as many episodes as you want. If you have to leave early, let people know that they can keep watching if they want.
  9. If you're using a skip list check to see what the next episode is.
    - If you're on Netflix, you have to use the "Next Episode" button, you can't use the in-player episode selector without breaking the party and starting a new one
    - If you have to skip a lot of episodes you can start a new party if you want and drop the link in the server.
  10. Have Fun!
